==================

Slingshot provides a HTML/Mobile Web client and library for Microsoft SharePoint Server 2010.  Using jQuery Mobile, Slingshot makes it easy to expose tasks, appointments, documents, and other objects from any SharePoint 2010 instance to a mobile device.

To see how this works, checkout http://neudesic.github.com/slingshot

Quick Start
-----------

1. Clone the repository, 'git clone https://github.com/neudesic/slingshot.git'

2. Modify the compat.browser file in SharePoint (often found in c:\inetpub\wwwroot\wss\VirtualDirectories\80\App_Browsers).  Locate the sections that apply to your devices, and set the isMobileDevice value to false.  An example of how to do this for the iPhone can be found in the Support folder.

3. Create a new virtual directory (e.g. slingshot) under the SharePoint route in Inetmgr, and add the index.html, Scripts, and Styles folders.

Browse to http://yourserver/slingshot from your mobile device!
